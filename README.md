## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - SASS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3) - Bootstrap

### What I learned

I have used scss in this project to get to know about sass and scss.
I have learned about how we can compile the scss file so that it will convert the scss file to css file and we can use it in the browser.
